# Flow Builder - Detailed Action Logs Update

## Summary
Enhanced the "Building comprehensive flow guide" step in the Build Flow Mode to show detailed sub-actions, giving users better visibility into what the agent is doing during the guide generation process.

## Changes Made

### Before
The "Building comprehensive flow guide" step was a single action that showed:
- 🏗️ Building comprehensive flow guide → "Generating step-by-step instructions with AI"

This didn't show the multiple internal operations happening during guide generation.

### After
Now the "Building comprehensive flow guide" step is broken down into **9 detailed sub-actions**:

1. **📝 Preparing context** → "Gathering flow foundations and component details"
   - Assembles the base context including flow analysis and found components
   - Adds flow building foundations (rules about triggers, actions, routers, loops, etc.)

2. **🎯 Processing trigger details** → "Gathering trigger configuration info"
   - Processes the identified trigger piece
   - Gathers trigger matches and suggestions
   - Shows count of trigger options processed

3. **📦 Loading piece capabilities** → "Loading details for X pieces"
   - Loads full action/trigger lists for each relevant piece
   - Shows how many piece summaries were loaded

4. **🤖 Identifying AI utilities** → "Checking for Text AI, Utility AI, Image AI, Video AI"
   - Detects if the flow needs ActivePieces AI utilities
   - Shows how many AI utilities were identified

5. **⚙️ Determining action strategies** → "Planning strategies for X actions"
   - Analyzes each action to determine the best implementation approach
   - Checks for native pieces, alternatives, or fallbacks needed
   - Shows count of strategies planned

6. **📖 Loading fallback documentation** → "Getting HTTP Request/Custom Code docs" (conditional)
   - Only runs if HTTP Request or Custom Code fallbacks are needed
   - Loads relevant documentation and guidelines
   - Shows which fallback types were loaded

7. **📚 Adding knowledge base context** → "Including X relevant docs" (conditional)
   - Only runs if knowledge base context is available
   - Adds RAG-enhanced recommendations from vector store
   - Shows count of context items added

8. **🌐 Searching web for missing info** → "Researching X missing components" (conditional)
   - Only runs if web search is enabled AND there are missing components
   - Performs web searches to fill knowledge gaps
   - Shows count of missing components researched

9. **✨ Generating comprehensive guide** → "Using {model} with {reasoning_effort} reasoning"
   - The actual AI generation step
   - Shows which model is being used (gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano)
   - Shows reasoning effort level (low, medium, high)
   - Reports final character count of generated guide

10. **🎉 Flow guide build complete** → "All X steps completed successfully"
    - Final summary showing total steps completed
    - Provides overall timing for the entire process

## Benefits

### Better User Experience
- Users can now see exactly what the agent is doing at each stage
- No more "black box" - users understand the process
- Progress tracking is more granular and informative

### Better Debugging
- If something goes wrong, easier to identify which sub-step failed
- Timing information for each sub-step helps identify bottlenecks
- Conditional steps only show when they actually run

### Better Transparency
- Users see when web search is being used
- Users see when fallback documentation is loaded
- Users see which AI model and reasoning level is selected

## Example Action Log Sequence

For a typical flow request, users will now see:

```
1. 🧠 Analyzing flow request → "Create a workflow that..."
2. ✅ Analysis complete → "Goal: Send Slack notifications..."
3. 🔎 Searching ActivePieces database → "Finding triggers, actions, and pieces"
4. ✅ Database search complete → "Found 3 actions, 2 triggers"
5. 🏗️ Building comprehensive flow guide → "Starting multi-step guide generation"
6. 📝 Preparing context → "Gathering flow foundations and component details"
7. ✅ Context prepared → "Flow foundations added"
8. 🎯 Processing trigger details → "Gathering trigger configuration info"
9. ✅ Trigger details processed → "Processed 2 trigger options"
10. 📦 Loading piece capabilities → "Loading details for 3 pieces"
11. ✅ Piece capabilities loaded → "Loaded 3 piece summaries"
12. 🤖 Identifying AI utilities → "Checking for Text AI, Utility AI, Image AI, Video AI"
13. ✅ AI utilities identified → "Found 0 AI utilities"
14. ⚙️ Determining action strategies → "Planning strategies for 3 actions"
15. ✅ Action strategies determined → "Planned strategies for 3 actions"
16. ✨ Generating comprehensive guide → "Using gpt-5-mini with medium reasoning"
17. ✅ AI generation completed → "Generated 4523 character guide"
18. 🎉 Flow guide build complete → "All 18 steps completed successfully"
```

## Technical Details

### Implementation
- All timing is tracked using `time.time()` for accurate duration reporting
- Each sub-step emits logs with:
  - Icon (emoji for visual identification)
  - Action name (what's happening)
  - Detail (additional context)
  - Status (started/completed)
  - Duration (time taken in seconds)

### Conditional Steps
Some steps only run when needed:
- **Fallback documentation** (step 6): Only if HTTP Request or Custom Code is needed
- **Knowledge base context** (step 7): Only if context is available
- **Web search** (step 8): Only if enabled and there are missing components

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: All operations were already happening, we just added logging
- No additional API calls or database queries
- Logging is async and doesn't block the main process

## Files Modified
- `src/flow_builder.py` - Added detailed action logging throughout `build_comprehensive_plan()` method

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with a simple flow request (should see fewer steps)
2. Test with a complex flow request (should see all steps)
3. Test with web search enabled (should see web search step)
4. Test with missing pieces (should see fallback documentation step)
5. Verify all timings are accurate and sub-step durations add up to total duration

## Future Enhancements
Possible future improvements:
- Add sub-steps for the analysis phase (currently 1 step)
- Add sub-steps for the search phase (currently 1 step, but uses parallel searches internally)
- Add progress percentages for each step
- Add estimated time remaining based on historical data
