# 7. Process Check
ps aux | grep uvicorn
# Expected: uvicorn process running

# 8. Port Check
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E '(80|443|8000)'
# Expected: All three ports LISTEN
```

npm install
npm run build
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### View Logs

```bash
# Backend

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| 502 Bad Gateway | `sudo systemctl restart flow-assistant-backend` |
| Frontend not loading | Check `dist/` exists, restart nginx |
| Database errors | Check file exists, verify permissions |
| Backend won't start | Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u flow-assistant-backend -n 50` |
| Out of memory | Reduce workers or upgrade droplet |
| SSL expired | `sudo certbot renew` |
| Can't connect via SSH | Check firewall allows port 22 |
