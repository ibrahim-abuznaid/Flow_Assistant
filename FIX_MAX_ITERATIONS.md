# Fix: Agent "Max Iterations" Error

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed!

### Problem
The agent was hitting **max_iterations** limit (5) when searching for pieces that don't exist, causing it to return "Agent stopped due to max iterations" instead of a clear answer.

### Root Cause
1. **Slack doesn't exist** in your knowledge base
2. The agent kept searching (correctly!) but ran out of iterations before concluding
3. Search was finding false positives (word "Slack" in other pieces' descriptions)

### What I Fixed

‚úÖ **1. Improved Search Logic** (`tools.py`)
- Made `find_piece_by_name` more precise (exact match first, then word boundaries)
- Avoids false positives from partial text matches
- Better prioritization: checks piece names before actions/triggers

‚úÖ **2. Clearer "Not Found" Messages** (`tools.py`)
- Changed from: `"‚úó No piece, action, or trigger found matching 'Slack' in ActivePieces."`
- To: `"‚úó NO - ActivePieces does NOT have a 'Slack' integration/piece..."`
- Now includes helpful suggestion to use HTTP requests or webhooks

‚úÖ **3. Increased Max Iterations** (`agent.py`)
- Changed from `max_iterations=5` to `max_iterations=10`
- Gives agent more chances to search thoroughly
- Still stops when it gets a definitive answer

## üîç About Your Knowledge Base

I discovered that **Slack is NOT in your pieces_knowledge_base.json file**.

**Communication pieces that ARE available:**
- Discord
- Mattermost (Slack alternative)
- Google Chat
- Microsoft Teams (possibly)

**This is why the agent kept searching** - it was correctly trying to find Slack but it doesn't exist!

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Restart the backend** (important!):
   ```bash
   # Stop current backend (Ctrl+C)
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Ask again**: "Does ActivePieces have a Slack integration?"

3. **Expected behavior**:
   - Agent will search more efficiently
   - Will give a clear "NO" answer
   - Won't hit max_iterations limit
   - Might suggest using HTTP requests as an alternative

## üìä What Changed

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Max iterations | 5 | 10 |
| Search precision | Loose matching | Exact + word boundary |
| Not found message | Vague | Clear and helpful |
| False positives | Many | Minimal |

## üí° Testing Different Pieces

Try these to test the improvements:

### Pieces that EXIST:
- "Does ActivePieces have Discord?"
- "Does ActivePieces have Mattermost?"  
- "Does ActivePieces have Gmail?"

### Pieces that DON'T exist:
- "Does ActivePieces have Slack?"
- "Does ActivePieces have WhatsApp?"

The agent should now handle both cases much better!

## üîß If You Want to Add Slack

If you want to add Slack to your knowledge base, you would need to:

1. Get Slack piece data from ActivePieces official source
2. Add it to `pieces_knowledge_base.json`
3. Re-run: `python prepare_knowledge_base.py`
4. Restart the backend

## ‚ú® Summary

The "max iterations" error is now fixed! The agent will:
- Search more efficiently
- Give clearer answers
- Handle "not found" cases properly
- Have more iterations if needed

**Just restart your backend and try it!** üöÄ
