# Frontend Action Logs Update

## Overview
Added detailed sequential action logging to the frontend so users can see every step the agent takes in real-time.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`src/main.py`)

1. **Enhanced StatusCallbackHandler Class**:
   - Added `action_counter` to track the number of actions
   - Modified `on_agent_action()` to send detailed action logs with:
     - Step number
     - Icon for each action type
     - Action description
     - Optional detail (like query text)
     - Status (started, completed, thinking, etc.)
   - Added `_format_tool_input()` method to format tool inputs for display
   - Updated `on_tool_end()` to send completion logs
   - Updated `on_llm_start()` to log reasoning steps
   - Updated `on_agent_finish()` to log finalization

2. **Tool Action Messages**:
   - 🔍 Checking ActivePieces database
   - 📚 Searching knowledge base
   - 🌐 Searching the web
   - 📝 Getting code generation guidelines
   - ✅ Tool completed
   - 🤔 Analyzing and reasoning
   - ✨ Finalizing response

3. **Build Flow Mode Logging**:
   - Added action logs for flow builder steps:
     - 🚀 Starting Flow Builder
     - 🔍 Analyzing your flow request
     - 🏗️ Building comprehensive flow guide
     - ✨ Flow guide completed

4. **Regular Agent Mode Logging**:
   - Added initial action logs:
     - 🚀 Starting agent
     - 🤖 Processing your query

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)

1. **New State**:
   - Added `actionLogs` state to accumulate action logs

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Added handling for `action_log` event type from backend
   - Accumulates logs with step number, icon, action, detail, and status
   - Clears logs when starting a new request

3. **UI Component**:
   - Added `action-logs-container` section that displays when loading
   - Shows all action logs sequentially (one under the other)
   - Each log shows icon, action name, and optional detail
   - Positioned above the status indicator and typing indicator

### CSS Changes (`frontend/src/App.css`)

1. **Action Logs Container**:
   - Gradient background with blue border
   - Animated slide-in effect
   - Box shadow for depth

2. **Individual Action Log Items**:
   - White background with colored left border
   - Border color changes based on status:
     - Blue (#667eea) for started
     - Green (#20bf6b) for completed
     - Orange (#ffa500) for thinking
     - Purple (#5f27cd) for analyzing
     - Cyan (#00d2d3) for building
   - Hover effect with slight translation
   - Pulse animation for active actions

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Adjusted padding and sizing for mobile devices
   - Smaller fonts and icons on small screens

## How It Works

1. **Backend**: When the agent performs any action (tool use, reasoning, etc.), the `StatusCallbackHandler` sends an `action_log` event through the SSE stream with details about what's happening.

2. **Frontend**: The frontend receives these events and adds them to the `actionLogs` array, which is rendered sequentially in a dedicated container.

3. **Display**: All action logs are displayed one after the other (not replacing each other), giving users complete visibility into the agent's process.

## Benefits

- **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what the agent is doing at each step
- **Debugging**: Easier to understand if the agent is stuck or what it's searching for
- **Engagement**: Keeps users informed during longer operations
- **Educational**: Helps users understand how the agent works

## Example Output

When a user asks a question, they'll see logs like:

```
🔍 Agent Actions
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 Starting agent

🤖 Processing your query
    "How do I use Slack to send messages?"

🔍 Checking ActivePieces database
    "Slack send message action"

✅ Tool completed

🤔 Analyzing and reasoning

📚 Searching knowledge base
    "Slack send message action inputs"

✅ Tool completed

🤔 Analyzing and reasoning

✨ Finalizing response
```

## Testing

To test the feature:

1. Start the backend: `python run.py`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Ask any question and watch the action logs appear sequentially
4. Try Build Flow Mode to see flow-specific action logs

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add timestamps to each log entry
- Make logs collapsible/expandable
- Add color coding for different types of actions
- Save action logs with the session history
- Add ability to export logs for debugging
