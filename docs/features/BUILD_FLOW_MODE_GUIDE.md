## How to Use

### Step 1: Enable Build Flow Mode

In the UI, check the **üîß Build Flow Mode** checkbox above the input area.

When enabled, you'll see:
- A confirmation message: "Build Flow Mode (Active)"
- A description: "Get comprehensive step-by-step flow building guides"
- The placeholder text changes to: "Describe the flow you want to build..."

### Step 2: Describe Your Flow

Enter a description of the flow you want to build. Examples:

**Simple Flows:**
- "Send an email when a new file is added to Google Drive"
- "Post to Slack when a new row is added to Google Sheets"
- "Create a Discord message when someone fills out a form"

**Moderate Flows:**
- "When I receive a payment in Stripe, send a welcome email and add them to Mailchimp"
- "Monitor RSS feeds and post new articles to Twitter and LinkedIn"
- "Create Trello cards from incoming webhooks"

**Complex Flows:**
- "Automate my customer onboarding process"
- "Build a lead management system"
- "Create an automated content publishing workflow"

### Step 3: Review and Follow the Guide

The AI will:
1. Analyze your request (üîç Analyzing your flow request...)
2. Search for required pieces and information
3. Generate a comprehensive guide
4. Optionally provide clarifying questions at the end

The guide will be formatted in markdown with:
- Clear headers and sections
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Code blocks for configuration examples
- Tables for input properties (when applicable)

### Step 4: Optional Clarifications

If the AI includes clarifying questions at the end, you can:
- **Answer them**: Simply respond with your answers in regular mode or Build Flow mode
- **Ignore them**: The guide is complete without answers; clarifications just add specificity

**Example Body with Data Mapping:**
```
A new file has been added to Google Drive:

File Name: {{trigger.file.name}}
File Type: {{trigger.file.mimeType}}
Added By: {{trigger.file.owner.displayName}}
File Link: {{trigger.file.webViewLink}}
Added On: {{trigger.file.createdTime}}
```

**Optional Inputs:**
- **CC**: Carbon copy recipients
- **BCC**: Blind carbon copy recipients
- **Reply To**: Custom reply-to address

### Step 4: Test Your Flow
1. Click "Test Flow" button

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Email not sending
- **Solution**: Check email action authentication and verify recipient address

**Issue**: Not detecting new files
- **Solution**: Verify folder path is correct and you have permissions

**Issue**: Trigger firing multiple times for same file
- **Solution**: Check polling interval and de-duplication settings

## Pro Tips
- Use filters to monitor specific file types only
- Include file thumbnails in email by using {{trigger.file.thumbnailLink}}
- Set up multiple actions (e.g., Slack notification + Email)
- Use conditional logic to handle different file types differently

## Technical Details

### Architecture

Build Flow Mode uses a specialized pipeline:

1. **Flow Analyzer** (GPT-5)
   - Analyzes the user request
   - Identifies triggers and actions
   - Determines clarity and confidence
   - Generates clarifying questions

2. **Component Searcher**
   - Searches SQLite database for pieces
   - Uses FAISS vector store for semantic search
   - Retrieves detailed piece information

3. **Flow Planner** (GPT-5)
   - Synthesizes all information
   - Creates comprehensive guide
   - Uses web search if needed
   - Formats output in markdown

### Configuration

Environment variables in `.env`:

```env
# Flow Builder Model (gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, or gpt-5-nano)
FLOW_BUILDER_MODEL=gpt-5-mini

# For complex flows, you can use the full model:
# FLOW_BUILDER_MODEL=gpt-5
```

**Recommended Settings:**
- `gpt-5-mini`: Best for most flows (fast, cost-effective)
- `gpt-5`: Use for very complex or critical flows (more reasoning power)
- `gpt-5-nano`: Use for simple flows (fastest, cheapest)

### API Integration

The build flow mode is integrated into the chat endpoint:

```javascript
// Frontend request
{
  "message": "Send an email when a new file is added to Google Drive",
  "session_id": "session_123...",
  "build_flow_mode": true  // ‚Üê Enable Build Flow Mode
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Be Specific**: Include details about your use case
   - ‚úÖ "Send Gmail notification when Google Sheets row added with order details"
   - ‚ùå "Automate my stuff"

2. **Mention Tools**: Specify which integrations you want to use
   - ‚úÖ "Use Slack and Trello to track support tickets"
   - ‚ùå "Track support tickets"

3. **State Goals**: Explain what you want to accomplish
   - ‚úÖ "I want to automatically backup form submissions to Google Sheets and email me"
   - ‚ùå "Help with forms"

4. **Answer Questions**: If clarifying questions appear, answering them improves the guide

### For Developers

1. **Model Selection**: Use `gpt-5-mini` by default, `gpt-5` for complex flows
2. **Error Handling**: The flow builder gracefully handles missing pieces
3. **Caching**: Pieces are cached for performance
4. **Logging**: All flow building requests are logged for debugging
