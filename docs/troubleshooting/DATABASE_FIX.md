# Database Path Fix

## Issue
After reorganization, the database path was pointing to the old location, causing "no such table" errors.

## What Was Wrong
```python
# OLD (incorrect after reorganization)
DB_FILE = os.getenv('SQLITE_DB_FILE', 'activepieces.db')

# NEW (correct)
DB_FILE = os.getenv('SQLITE_DB_FILE', 'data/activepieces.db')
```

## Fixed In
- `src/db_config.py` - Updated database path to `data/activepieces.db`

## Verification
Run this to test:
```bash
python src/db_config.py
```

Expected output:
```
[OK] Database connected successfully! Found 433 pieces.
```

## Status
âœ… Fixed and verified - database has:
- 433 pieces (integrations)
- 2,678 actions
- 694 triggers
- 9,664 action properties

## If You Still Have Issues
1. Make sure the database file exists: `data/activepieces.db`
2. Check file size: Should be ~2.3 MB
3. Run the test: `python src/db_config.py`
4. Restart your server
