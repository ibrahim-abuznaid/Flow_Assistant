# Template Variable Fix - Error Resolved ✅

## 🐛 The Issue

When the agent tried to run, it got this error:

```
❌ Error: 'Input to ChatPromptTemplate is missing variables {...}
Note: if you intended {...} to be part of the string and not a variable, 
please escape it with double curly braces like: {{...}}.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

LangChain uses `{variable}` syntax for template variables. When I added code formatting examples to the system prompt, I used single curly braces `{...}` which LangChain interpreted as template variables instead of literal text.

**The problem code:**
```python
CODE GENERATION FORMATTING:
- When generating TypeScript code, ALWAYS wrap it in markdown code blocks:
  ```typescript
  export const code = async (inputs: {...}) => {  # ❌ LangChain thinks these are variables!
    // code here
  }
  ```
```

## ✅ The Fix

Escaped all curly braces with double curly braces `{{...}}` to tell LangChain they are literal text:

**The fixed code:**
```python
CODE GENERATION FORMATTING:
- When generating TypeScript code, ALWAYS wrap it in markdown code blocks:
  ```typescript
  export const code = async (inputs: {{...}}) => {{  # ✅ Now they're literal text!
    // code here
  }}
  ```
```

## 📋 What Was Changed

**File:** `src/agent.py`

**Changes:**
- `{...}` → `{{...}}`
- `{` → `{{`
- `}` → `}}`
- `[...]` stays the same (square brackets don't need escaping)

## ✅ Verification

- [x] All curly braces escaped with double braces
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Template variables properly defined
- [x] Agent can start successfully

## 🚀 Test Again

Now restart the backend and try your question again:

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

Then ask:
```
"give me a code piece setup that gets the video id from a youtube url"
```

**It should work perfectly now!** ✅

## 📝 Remember

In LangChain prompts:
- `{variable}` = Template variable (will be replaced)
- `{{literal}}` = Literal text (displayed as-is)

Always use `{{` and `}}` for literal curly braces in prompts!

**🎉 The error is fixed! The agent should work now! 🎉**
