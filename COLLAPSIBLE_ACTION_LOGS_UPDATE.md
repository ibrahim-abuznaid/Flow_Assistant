# Collapsible Action Logs Update

## Summary of Changes

Updated the action logs feature to:
1. ✅ **Removed "Tool completed" logs** - No longer shows repetitive completion messages
2. ✅ **Made logs collapsible** - Default closed, user can expand to see details
3. ✅ **Persist logs after response** - Logs remain visible with each assistant message
4. ✅ **Works in both modes** - Normal mode and Build Flow Mode

## Changes Made

### Backend (`src/main.py`)

#### Removed Tool Completion Logs
```python
def on_tool_end(self, output: str, **kwargs) -> None:
    """Called when a tool finishes."""
    try:
        self._check_cancellation()
        
        # Just update status, don't log completion
        self.status_queue.put({"type": "status", "message": "💭 Thinking...", "tool": None})
    except CancellationException:
        raise
```

**What changed**: Removed the "✅ Tool completed" action log that was being sent after each tool use.

### Frontend (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)

#### 1. New State Management
```javascript
const [actionLogs, setActionLogs] = useState([]) // Current action logs for active request
const [completedActionLogs, setCompletedActionLogs] = useState([]) // Completed action logs with responses
```

**Purpose**: 
- `actionLogs`: Stores logs for the currently running request
- `completedActionLogs`: Stores logs associated with completed responses

#### 2. Created CollapsibleActionLogs Component
```javascript
const CollapsibleActionLogs = ({ logs }) => {
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false)
  
  // Default collapsed (false)
  // Shows toggle button with step count
  // Expands to show all action logs
}
```

**Features**:
- Default state: **Collapsed (closed)**
- Toggle button shows: "🔍 Agent Actions (X steps)"
- Click to expand/collapse
- Smooth animations

#### 3. Associate Logs with Messages
```javascript
// When response completes, save the logs
if (data.type === 'done') {
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, { sender: 'assistant', text: data.reply }])
  // Save the current action logs with the response
  setCompletedActionLogs(prev => [...prev, {
    id: Date.now(),
    logs: [...actionLogs],
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }])
}
```

**Logic**: 
- Each assistant response gets its own set of action logs
- Logs are matched to responses by index
- Logs persist even after the response is complete

#### 4. Display Logs with Messages
```javascript
{messages.map((msg, idx) => {
  // Find action logs for this assistant message
  let msgActionLogs = null
  if (msg.sender === 'assistant') {
    const assistantMsgIndex = messages.slice(0, idx + 1)
      .filter(m => m.sender === 'assistant').length - 1
    if (completedActionLogs[assistantMsgIndex]) {
      msgActionLogs = completedActionLogs[assistantMsgIndex].logs
    }
  }
  return <Message msg={msg} actionLogs={msgActionLogs} />
})}
```

**How it works**:
- Counts assistant messages up to current position
- Retrieves corresponding action logs
- Passes logs to Message component

#### 5. Clear Logs on New Session
```javascript
const resetConversation = async () => {
  setMessages([])
  setCompletedActionLogs([]) // Clear completed action logs
  setActionLogs([]) // Clear current action logs
}
```

### CSS Styles (`frontend/src/App.css`)

#### Collapsible Toggle Button
```css
.action-logs-toggle {
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.6rem;
  padding: 0.7rem 1rem;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.08) 0%, rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.08) 100%);
  border: 1px solid rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.3);
  border-radius: 8px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}
```

**Features**:
- Gradient background
- Hover effects
- Smooth transitions
- Full width button

#### Completed Action Logs Container
```css
.action-logs-list.completed {
  margin-top: 0.6rem;
  padding: 0.8rem;
  background: rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.03);
  border-radius: 6px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.15);
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease-in;
}
```

**Style**: Subtle, contained look that doesn't overpower the message

## User Experience

### Before Response (While Loading)
```

🚀 Starting agent

🤖 Processing your query
    "How do I use Slack?"

🔍 Checking ActivePieces database

## Key Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface**: Logs don't clutter the UI by default
2. **User Control**: Users can expand logs when needed for debugging
3. **Transparency**: Full action history available on demand
4. **Persistent**: Logs remain with each response for future reference
5. **No Redundancy**: Removed repetitive "Tool completed" messages
6. **Works in Both Modes**: Normal mode and Build Flow Mode both supported

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Normal Mode Action Logs
1. Start the app
2. Ask a question: "How do I send Slack messages?"
3. Watch logs appear in real-time during processing
4. After response, verify:
   - Logs are collapsed by default
   - Toggle button shows step count
   - Clicking expands/collapses logs
   - No "Tool completed" messages

### Test 2: Build Flow Mode Action Logs
1. Enable Build Flow Mode toggle
2. Ask: "Create a flow to send Slack notifications"
3. Verify:
   - Flow-specific logs appear (Starting Flow Builder, etc.)
   - Logs collapse after response
   - Can expand to see all steps

### Test 3: Multiple Messages
1. Ask 3 different questions in sequence
2. Verify:
   - Each response has its own collapsible logs
   - Expanding one doesn't affect others
   - Logs are correctly associated with responses

### Test 4: Session Management
1. Start a conversation with logs
2. Click "New Session"
3. Verify all logs are cleared
4. Ask a new question
5. Verify fresh logs appear

### Test 5: Large Responses
1. Ask a complex question that requires many tool calls
2. Verify:
   - All actions are logged
   - No "Tool completed" clutter
   - Toggle shows accurate step count
   - Logs are readable when expanded

## Technical Notes

### Log Association Logic
- Logs are matched to responses by counting assistant messages
- Each assistant message index corresponds to a completedActionLogs entry
- This ensures correct log-message pairing even with multiple exchanges

### State Management
- `actionLogs`: Temporary, cleared on each new request
- `completedActionLogs`: Persistent array of log sets
- Each entry: `{ id, logs, timestamp }`

### Performance Considerations
- Logs are only rendered when expanded
- React memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Minimal impact on initial render time

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add timestamps to each log entry
- Color code by action type
- Add search/filter for logs
- Export logs as JSON/text
- Show execution time per action
- Add log statistics (total time, number of searches, etc.)
