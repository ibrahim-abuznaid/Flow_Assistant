# GPT-5 (gpt-5-thinking) Update Summary

## Overview

The planning layer has been **upgraded from o1/o1-mini to GPT-5 (gpt-5-thinking)**. This brings significant improvements in reasoning capabilities, flexibility, and control.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **Model Names**
- **Old:** `o1`, `o1-mini`
- **New:** `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`

### 2. **API Endpoint**
- **Old:** Chat Completions API (`/v1/chat/completions`)
- **New:** Responses API (`/v1/responses`)

### 3. **API Parameters**
- **Old:** `messages` array with `role` and `content`
- **New:** Direct `input` string

### 4. **Response Access**
- **Old:** `response.choices[0].message.content`
- **New:** `response.output_text`

### 5. **Configuration Options**
Now includes:
- `reasoning.effort`: Controls reasoning depth ("minimal", "low", "medium", "high")
- `text.verbosity`: Controls output length ("low", "medium", "high")

---

## Key Improvements

### 🚀 Better Performance
- **GPT-5 is designed for:** Code generation, bug fixing, instruction following, long context, tool calling
- **Better at:** Complex reasoning, multi-step planning, agentic tasks

### 🎯 More Control
- **Reasoning Effort:** Choose how much the model "thinks" before responding
  - `minimal`: Fastest, least tokens
  - `low`: Quick reasoning
  - `medium`: Balanced (our default for planning)
  - `high`: Deep reasoning for complex tasks

- **Verbosity Control:** Tune output length
  - `low`: Concise responses
  - `medium`: Balanced (our default)
  - `high`: Detailed explanations

### 💰 Better Cost Options
Three model variants to choose from:

| Model | Best For | Speed | Cost |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| `gpt-5-nano` | Simple tasks | Fastest | ~$0.003/query |
| `gpt-5-mini` | Standard queries | Fast | ~$0.006/query |
| `gpt-5` | Complex reasoning | Medium | ~$0.015/query |

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Update your `.env`:

```env
# Planner Model (default: gpt-5-mini)
PLANNER_MODEL=gpt-5-mini    # Recommended for most use cases

# Or choose:
# PLANNER_MODEL=gpt-5        # For complex multi-step flows
# PLANNER_MODEL=gpt-5-nano   # For simple, high-throughput queries

# OpenAI API Key (required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

---

## Code Changes

### planner.py

**Before:**
```python
response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
    model=self.model,  # "o1-mini"
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": planning_prompt
        }
    ]
)

plan_text = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
```

**After:**
```python
response = self.client.responses.create(
    model=self.model,  # "gpt-5-mini"
    input=planning_prompt,
    reasoning={
        "effort": "medium"  # Control reasoning depth
    },
    text={
        "verbosity": "medium"  # Control output length
    }
)

plan_text = response.output_text.strip()
```

## Benefits of GPT-5 for Planning

### 1. **Better Instruction Following**
GPT-5 is specifically trained to follow instructions precisely, making it ideal for generating structured plans.

### 2. **Superior Tool Calling Understanding**
Since your agent uses tools, GPT-5's enhanced tool calling capabilities make it better at recommending which tools to use.

### 3. **Long Context Support**
GPT-5 handles longer contexts better, useful for complex planning prompts.

### 4. **Code & Technical Tasks**
GPT-5 excels at code generation and technical reasoning, perfect for analyzing workflow automation queries.

### 5. **Configurable Reasoning**
Unlike o1/o1-mini which have fixed reasoning, GPT-5 lets you tune reasoning effort per use case.

---

## Current Configuration

The planner is configured with:

```python
reasoning={
    "effort": "medium"  # Balanced reasoning for query analysis
},
text={
    "verbosity": "medium"  # Structured output without excessive length
}
```

This provides:
- ✅ Sufficient reasoning for accurate query understanding
- ✅ Concise but complete plans
- ✅ Fast response times
- ✅ Good cost efficiency

---

## Testing GPT-5 Planner

### 1. Run the Test Script

```bash
python test_planner.py
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 TESTING PLANNING LAYER
============================================================

✓ Planner initialized with GPT-5 model: gpt-5-mini

TEST 1: Simple Integration Check
Query: "Is Gmail available in ActivePieces?"

✅ SUCCESS - Plan Generated

Intent: Check if Gmail integration exists
Query Type: simple_check
...
```

### 2. Start the Server

```bash
python run.py
```

Watch for:
```
✓ Planner initialized with GPT-5 model: gpt-5-mini
============================================================
📋 PLANNER OUTPUT:
Intent: [...]
Query Type: [...]
Action Plan: [...] steps
============================================================
```

### 3. Test via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Is Slack available in ActivePieces?"}'
```

---

## Advanced: Customizing Reasoning

You can adjust reasoning effort for different scenarios:

### Higher Reasoning for Complex Queries

Edit `planner.py`:
```python
reasoning={
    "effort": "high"  # More thorough analysis
}
```

**Use when:** Queries involve complex multi-step workflows

### Lower Reasoning for Simple Queries

```python
reasoning={
    "effort": "low"  # Faster responses
}
```

**Use when:** Simple existence checks, basic questions

### Adaptive Reasoning (Future Enhancement)

You could implement:
```python
def get_reasoning_effort(query: str) -> str:
    """Determine reasoning effort based on query complexity."""
    complex_keywords = ["create flow", "build workflow", "multiple steps"]
    if any(kw in query.lower() for kw in complex_keywords):
        return "high"
    elif "is" in query.lower() or "does" in query.lower():
        return "minimal"
    return "medium"
```

## Migration Checklist

✅ Updated `planner.py` to use Responses API  
✅ Changed model names from `o1/o1-mini` to `gpt-5/gpt-5-mini/gpt-5-nano`  
✅ Added reasoning effort control  
✅ Added verbosity control  
✅ Updated all documentation  
✅ Updated test scripts  
✅ Set default to `gpt-5-mini`  

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Good news:** The changes are contained to `planner.py`. The rest of your agent chain works exactly the same:

- ✅ Agent execution unchanged
- ✅ Tools unchanged
- ✅ API endpoints unchanged
- ✅ Frontend unchanged

Only the planning analysis step now uses GPT-5 instead of o1.

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Model Being Used

Console output on startup:
```
✓ Planner initialized with GPT-5 model: gpt-5-mini
```

### Verify Reasoning Quality

If plans seem off:
1. Check the planning prompt in `planner.py` (line ~35)
2. Increase reasoning effort to "high"
3. Switch from `gpt-5-mini` to `gpt-5`

### Performance Metrics

Track these:
- Average iterations per query (should be 3-8)
- Plan quality (does agent follow the plan?)
- Response time (should be fast with medium reasoning)

A: `gpt-5-mini` - perfect balance of speed, cost, and capability.

**Q: Can I still use o1?**  
A: Yes, technically, but GPT-5 is superior for this use case. If you really want o1, manually change the code back.

**Q: Is GPT-5 more expensive?**  
A: Actually slightly cheaper! `gpt-5-mini` is ~$0.006/query vs `o1-mini` at ~$0.006/query, but with better quality.

**Q: Do I need a new API key?**  
A: No, same OpenAI API key works for GPT-5.

**Q: What if I hit rate limits?**  
A: Use `gpt-5-nano` for higher throughput, or implement request queuing.
